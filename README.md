React Native Todo App
A simple and clean todo app built with React Native, focusing on simplicity, clean code, and reusability. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed or not, and delete them. It does not use Redux for state management but instead relies on React's built-in state management. Additionally, it utilizes the AlertAsync library to provide users with alerts when they attempt to delete a task.

Features

Mark as completed: Tasks can be marked as completed or not with a simple toggle.
Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Clean code: The codebase is kept clean and readable, following best practices for React Native development.
Reusable components: Components are designed to be reusable and modular, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Dependencies
AlertAsync: A library used to display asynchronous alerts in React Native applications.
